## üí° About LoanBuddy
LoanBuddy is an interactive, Streamlit-based web application developed to simplify and streamline loan-related decision-making for both applicants and financial institutions. By leveraging robust machine learning models, the application provides real-time predictions and essential credit insights.

## ‚ú® Key Features
LoanBuddy provides three core services to users:

‚úÖ Loan Approval Status: Instantly check whether a loan application is likely to be Approved or Not Approved based on applicant and financial criteria.

üí∞ Loan Amount Prediction: Predict the Maximum Loan Amount that can be realistically sanctioned to the applicant.

üìä CIBIL Score Estimation: Estimate the applicant‚Äôs CIBIL Score (Credit Score) based on their historical financial behavior and credit profile.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Pipeline
### Models Implemented
The application utilizes a combination of supervised learning models, all trained using the Scikit-learn framework:

| Prediction Task | Model Used                   | Purpose                                                              |
| -------------   | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loan Approval   | GradientBoosting Classifier  |Binary classification for approval status (Approved/Not Approved).    |
| Loan Amount     | Ridge Regression             |Regression model to estimate the maximum sanctioned amount.           |
| CIBIL Score     | Custom CIBIL Score Estimator |A custom-derived model based on financial history and credit behavior.|

### Dataset
The models were trained on the Kaggle Loan Approval Prediction Dataset, a publicly available dataset widely used for loan eligibility and prediction tasks.

### End-to-End Workflow
The project demonstrates a complete ML production workflow, from data to deployment:

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Cleaning, scaling, and transforming raw data features.

### Model Training & Evaluation: Training classification and regression models using Scikit-learn.

### Model Serialization: Saving the trained models and preprocessors using Pickle (Classification.pkl and Regressor.pkl) for efficient loading in the web application.

### Deployment: Integrating the serialized models into an interactive, user-facing Streamlit application.

## UI/UX & Design Highlights
The user interface was built to be modern, intuitive, and highly responsive:

### Framework: Built entirely using Streamlit.

### Custom Styling: Enhanced aesthetics using custom CSS styling for a professional and modern feel.

### Interactive Elements: Features like gradient-based sliders and styled dropdowns for easy user input.

### Dynamic Visuals: Real-time results displayed using interactive Plotly charts (e.g., the CIBIL score gauge).

### Feedback: Provides dynamic success, warning, and error messages based on the loan approval results.
